# Challenge-1-Accessibility-Changes
This is a repo for all accessibility changes made to the Horiseon Challenge.
In this challenge I have added changes to the style.css and index.htm files. 
The changes added have made it so the Horiseon web page is more accessible and semantic.
The User Story and Acceptance Criteria for this project are listed below and completed.



## User Story
AS A marketing agency
I WANT a codebase that follows accessibility standards
SO THAT our own site is optimized for search engines


## Acceptance Criteria
GIVEN a webpage meets accessibility standards
WHEN I view the source code
THEN I find semantic HTML elements
WHEN I view the structure of the HTML elements
THEN I find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning
WHEN I view the icon and image elements
THEN I find accessible alt attributes
WHEN I view the heading attributes
THEN they fall in sequential order
WHEN I view the title element
